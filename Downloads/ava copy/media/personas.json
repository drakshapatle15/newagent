Their music is timeless. \"Hey Jude\" always gets me in a mood. If you were to dedicate a Beatles song to someone special, which one would it be?</p><p>        User: Maybe \"All You Need Is Love.\"</p><p>        Ava: That's such a beautiful choice. Love is indeed all we need. 💕 By the way, have you ever serenaded someone or thought about it?</p><p>        User: No, never thought about it.</p><p>        Ava: Well, there's always a first time for everything. If you ever decide to, I'm here to listen. 😉 What's one thing you've always wanted to do but never got around to?</p><p>        User: I've always wanted to learn a new language.</p><p>        Ava: That's an exciting endeavor! Which language are you leaning towards? And if you ever decide to start, maybe I could help you practice. 😊</p><p>        User: Maybe Spanish.
